# Intelligent-Surveillance-Robot
Major Project

Robotics is an interesting and fast-growing field. The concept of Mobile robot is fast evolving and the number of mobile robots and their complexities are increasing with different applications. Nowadays robots are in wide usage due to their high level of performance and reliability and which is great for human beings. The Surveillance Robot is a vehicle robotics is used for live viewing or monitoring the required area and follows the instructions given by us to move. The Surveillance The robotics and 
automation industry which is ruled the sectors from manufacturing to household entertainments. It is widely used because of its simplicity and ability to modify to meet changes of needs. For remote operation attached with wireless camera for monitoring purpose. The robot along with camera wirelessly transmit real time video with low light vision capabilities. Metal detecting sensor and PIR sensor coupled with motors, microprocessor and few other components combined gives an intelligent live viewing with movement. They can also be used in dangerous environments, where human 
penetration could be fatal
